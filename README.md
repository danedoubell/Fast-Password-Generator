# Fast-Password-Generator
This is a quick web app to generate a password with a sequence of keys that do not require the same finger twice in a row in order to type very fast when needed.

TL;DR
Generate a fresh password for safety; and since you have to learn a new one anyway, you might as well make it an efficient one to type out quickly.

Whether we utilise the principles of "touch-typing" or not, the layout of the QWERTY keyboard has shown to be a good efficient layout. When designed, the key usage frequency in English determined it's placement for the quickest access.

With passwords, people tend to use familiar "hooks" like a pet name or significant date in their passwords. This only trades off a brief period of learning a new "secure" password (eg. DJ?38jO1!z) for one that seems easier to remember (eg. Paris1931)

This generator aims to create a randomised password that has a goal of placing the sequence of characters in an order where maximum speed is achieved.

EXAMPLE:
12345 = Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Little (fingers)

L1 = Left Hand Finger 1
L2 = Left Hand Finger 2
R3 = Right Hand Finger 3
L3R5 = Left Hand Finger 3 + Right Hand Finger 5 (typically Shift key work for Capital lettering)

etc

DDTm9l - requires "L3R5,L3R5,L4R5,R2,R9,R9"

EjpUfs - requires "L3R5,R2,R5,R1L5,L2,L4"

The first is slower & more awkward, having to repeat some fingers; while the second has a faster flow where the any next character doesn't have to wait for a finger to free up. With longer passwords, this becomes even more apparent when repeating the password every day.
